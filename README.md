# Blindness-Detection.
The Blindness Deducon Projec ocuses on creang a compuer-aided diagnosis sysem ha
leverages Convoluonal Neural Nework (CNN) algorihms or he early deecon o Diabec
Renopahy (DR), a leading cause o blindness among diabec paens. The projec involves he
use o a large daase o eye images obained rom Kaggle, which has been preprocessed and
resized o a uniorm size o enhance he perormance o he CNN models. The projec also
involves he developmen o various CNN models using TensorFlow and Keras libraries, which
will be rained on he preprocessed daase. The perormance o hese models will be evaluaed
using dieren merics, such as accuracy, sensiviy, and speciciy. The ulmae goal o his
projec is o develop an accurae and ecien compuer-aided diagnosis sysem ha can assis
healhcare proessionals in he early deecon o DR, hus reducing he risk o blindness among
diabec paens.
